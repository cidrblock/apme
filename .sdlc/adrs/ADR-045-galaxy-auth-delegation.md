# ADR-045: Delegate Galaxy Authentication to ansible-galaxy, Galaxy Config as Scan Metadata

## Status

Proposed

## Date

2026-03-28

## Context

APME's Galaxy Proxy (ADR-031) converts Galaxy collection tarballs to Python
wheels and serves them via PEP 503.  The proxy also acts as the Galaxy V3 REST
API client — it implements `GalaxyClient` with `httpx`, manages per-server auth
headers, paginates version listings, and downloads tarballs directly from
upstream Galaxy / Automation Hub servers.

PR #130 proposes extending the proxy with:

- **SSO offline-token exchange** (`_SSOState`, Keycloak OIDC flow) for
  `console.redhat.com` Automation Hub
- **API root path normalization** for Automation Hub URL variations
- **`GALAXY_SERVER_LIST` env var parsing** (ansible.cfg-style multi-server
  config via environment variables)
- **Auth header forwarding** on tarball downloads
- **`auth_type` field** (token / bearer / sso) on `GalaxyServer`

All of this functionality already exists in `ansible-galaxy`, which is the
authoritative Galaxy API client maintained by the Ansible team:

- `ansible.cfg` `[galaxy_server_list]` with per-server sections
- SSO / offline-token exchange for `console.redhat.com` via `auth_url`
- Multiple auth types (`token`, `auth_url` for SSO)
- Multi-server fallback ordering
- Auth on tarball downloads
- `ansible-galaxy collection download` fetches tarballs without installing

Reimplementing this in the proxy creates a maintenance burden that must track
upstream Galaxy API and SSO endpoint changes indefinitely.  It also ignores the
user's existing `ansible.cfg` configuration — the standard place where Galaxy
server credentials are already configured.

### Forces

- CLI users already have `ansible.cfg` with Galaxy/AH server credentials
- UI users need per-project Galaxy server configuration (stored in Gateway DB)
- The engine is stateless (ADR-020) — it should not store credentials
- Galaxy auth complexity (SSO, token refresh, API path normalization) belongs
  in ansible-galaxy, not in our codebase
- The proxy's core value is tarball-to-wheel conversion and PEP 503 serving,
  not Galaxy API client implementation
- `ansible-core` is already installed in every session venv — `ansible-galaxy`
  is available there

### Constraints

- The Galaxy Proxy container currently does not have `ansible-core` installed
- No gRPC proto fields exist for Galaxy server configuration today
- Credentials must not be persisted by the engine (ADR-020, ADR-029)
- The engine never queries out (architectural invariant 11) — but
  `ansible-galaxy collection download` is a subprocess invocation within the
  pod, not an outbound query from engine code

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Delegate to ansible-galaxy + scan-scoped config (proposed)

Galaxy server configuration becomes scan-scoped metadata flowing through the
gRPC proto.  The CLI reads the user's `ansible.cfg` Galaxy sections and sends
them as `GalaxyServerDef` messages.  The UI/Gateway stores per-project Galaxy
server defs and injects them into scan requests.  The engine writes a temporary
`ansible.cfg` per session and delegates fetching to
`ansible-galaxy collection download`.  The proxy simplifies to tarball-to-wheel
conversion + PEP 503 serving.

**Pros:**
- Zero custom SSO/OIDC code — ansible-galaxy handles all auth
- Tracks upstream Galaxy API changes automatically
- CLI users get zero-config: their existing `ansible.cfg` just works
- UI can offer per-project Automation Hub credential management
- Single auth implementation shared with all Ansible tooling

**Cons:**
- `ansible-core` must be available where `ansible-galaxy collection download`
  runs (session venv, proxy container, or a shared utility)
- Proto change needed (`GalaxyServerDef` message on `ScanOptions`/`FixOptions`)
- Subprocess invocation adds latency vs direct HTTP (mitigated by caching)

### Option 2: Reimplement Galaxy auth in the proxy (PR #130's approach)

The proxy implements its own Galaxy V3 REST API client with SSO token exchange,
API root normalization, multi-server config via env vars, and auth header
forwarding.

**Pros:**
- Self-contained — proxy has no dependency on ansible-core
- Direct HTTP is slightly faster than subprocess

**Cons:**
- Duplicates battle-tested auth logic from ansible-galaxy
- Must track upstream Galaxy API, SSO endpoint, and auth protocol changes
- Ignores the user's existing `ansible.cfg` (requires separate env var config)
- No path for UI-driven per-project credentials (env vars are process-global)
- SSO token refresh, Keycloak quirks, and API path normalization are complex
  and error-prone to reimplement

### Option 3: Hybrid — proxy keeps simple token auth, adds ansible-galaxy for SSO

The proxy retains its existing `Authorization: Token` auth for simple Galaxy
servers.  For SSO-authenticated servers (Automation Hub), it delegates to
`ansible-galaxy collection download`.

**Pros:**
- Minimal change for simple Galaxy (public, private with token)
- SSO complexity delegated to ansible-galaxy

**Cons:**
- Two auth paths to maintain and reason about
- Still ignores the user's `ansible.cfg` for the token path
- Inconsistent behavior between auth types
- Eventually the simple path will also want ansible.cfg-style config

## Decision

**Option 1: Delegate Galaxy authentication to ansible-galaxy and flow Galaxy
server configuration as scan-scoped metadata through the gRPC proto.**

The proxy's role narrows to its core value: tarball-to-wheel conversion and
PEP 503 serving.  Galaxy API interaction — authentication, server discovery,
tarball downloading — is delegated to `ansible-galaxy collection download`,
which is the authoritative, maintained implementation.

Galaxy server configuration flows as scan metadata:

```
CLI (reads ansible.cfg) ──► gRPC ScanOptions.galaxy_servers ──► Primary
UI  (per-project config) ──► Gateway ──► gRPC ScanOptions     ──► Primary
                                                                     │
                                            Primary writes temp ansible.cfg
                                            ansible-galaxy collection download
                                                     │
                                              tarballs on disk
                                                     │
                                              Proxy: tarball → wheel
                                              PEP 503 serving
                                                     │
                                              pip/uv install wheel
```

### Why not Option 2

Reimplementing `ansible-galaxy`'s auth stack creates a parallel implementation
that must track upstream changes to the Galaxy V3 API, Red Hat SSO endpoints,
Keycloak OIDC flows, and Automation Hub URL conventions.  The initial design of
the proxy's `GalaxyClient` was over-engineered — it took on Galaxy API client
responsibilities that already have a well-maintained upstream implementation.
The proxy should focus on what only it can do: format conversion at the boundary.

### Why not Option 3

A hybrid approach creates two code paths for the same operation (fetching a
collection tarball), making the system harder to reason about and test.  If we
are going to use ansible-galaxy for the hard cases, we should use it for all
cases and eliminate the custom client entirely.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **No custom auth code**: SSO token exchange, API root normalization, and
  auth header forwarding are all handled by ansible-galaxy
- **Automatic upstream tracking**: Galaxy API changes, new auth methods, and
  Automation Hub URL conventions are picked up via ansible-core upgrades
- **CLI zero-config**: Users' existing `ansible.cfg` Galaxy server sections
  work without any APME-specific configuration
- **UI credential management**: Per-project Galaxy server defs stored in
  Gateway DB, injected into scan requests — enables Automation Hub integration
  from the web UI
- **Simplified proxy**: `galaxy_client.py` reduces to tarball-to-wheel
  conversion; no `httpx` dependency for Galaxy API calls
- **Security**: Credentials flow as scan-scoped metadata (in-transit on
  pod-local gRPC), never persisted by the engine, stored encrypted in
  Gateway DB

### Negative

- **ansible-core dependency**: `ansible-galaxy collection download` requires
  ansible-core.  Session venvs already have it; the proxy container may need
  it added, or the download step moves to Primary (which has access to session
  venvs)
- **Proto evolution**: New `GalaxyServerDef` message and field on
  `ScanOptions`/`FixOptions` — requires proto regeneration and client updates
- **Subprocess latency**: `ansible-galaxy collection download` is slower than
  direct HTTP for the first fetch (mitigated by proxy wheel cache — subsequent
  requests are instant cache hits)

### Neutral

- PR #130's bug fixes (naming hyphen-to-underscore, pagination via
  `links.next`, inline comment stripping) remain valuable and should be
  cherry-picked independently
- The `remediate.py` type annotation cleanup in PR #130 is unrelated and can
  be merged separately
- ADR-031's core decision (contain Galaxy format at the proxy boundary, serve
  wheels via PEP 503) is unchanged — this ADR narrows the proxy's
  responsibilities, not its purpose

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Proto + CLI plumbing

- Add `GalaxyServerDef` message to `common.proto` (`url`, `token`,
  `auth_url`, `name`, `auth_type`)
- Add `repeated GalaxyServerDef galaxy_servers` to `ScanOptions` and
  `FixOptions`
- CLI: parse `ansible.cfg` `[galaxy_server_list]` sections, populate
  `galaxy_servers` on scan requests
- Primary: write temp `ansible.cfg` from `galaxy_servers`, scope to session

### Phase 2: Engine integration

- Primary: use `ansible-galaxy collection download -p <session_dir>/tarballs/`
  with the generated `ansible.cfg` to fetch tarballs
- Proxy: add endpoint or filesystem watcher to convert local tarballs to
  wheels (or Primary hands tarballs directly to the converter)
- Remove `GalaxyClient` upstream fetching from proxy

### Phase 3: Gateway + UI

- Gateway: add `galaxy_servers` to project model (encrypted token storage)
- Gateway: inject `galaxy_servers` into gRPC requests when calling engine
- UI: per-project Galaxy server configuration form

### Cherry-pick from PR #130

These changes are valuable regardless of the auth delegation decision:

- `naming.py`: hyphen-to-underscore fix in `python_to_fqcn`
- `metadata.py`: inline comment stripping in requirements parsing
- `galaxy_client.py`: pagination via `links.next` URL (if client is retained
  for any fallback role)
- `remediate.py`: type annotation cleanup (`list[object]` → `list[Proposal]`)
