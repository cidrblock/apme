# Rule description document format

Rule `.md` files describe a single rule and provide examples that can be used both for documentation and for **integration tests**. The structure is standardized so a test runner can parse each file and assert that the engine produces the expected result (violation or pass) for each example.

## File location

- **Native rules:** `src/apme_engine/validators/native/rules/<rule_file_stem>.md` (e.g. `R102_command_instead_of_shell.md` next to `R102_command_instead_of_shell.py`).
- **OPA rules:** `src/apme_engine/validators/opa/bundle/<rule_id>.md` (e.g. `L001.md`, `R118.md` next to the `.rego` file).
- **Ansible rules:** `src/apme_engine/validators/ansible/rules/<rule_id>.md` (e.g. `L057.md`, `M001.md`).

## Structure

1. **YAML frontmatter** (optional but recommended for test harness)
   - `rule_id` — Rule identifier (e.g. `L029`, `R102`, `L001`).
   - `validator` — `native` or `opa`.
   - `description` — One-line description.

2. **Title and prose** — Human-readable explanation of what the rule checks.

3. **Examples** — Exactly two section types, each followed by a single fenced code block:
   - `### Example: violation` — Content that **must** trigger this rule. Integration test: run the snippet; assert the rule reports a violation.
   - `### Example: pass` — Content that **must not** trigger this rule. Integration test: run the snippet; assert the rule does not report a violation.

## Requirements for examples

- Each example is a **single fenced code block** (use `yaml` as the language).
- The content must be **valid Ansible YAML** that the engine can parse (e.g. a list of tasks, a play, or a minimal playbook/role layout as required by the rule).
- Snippets should be **minimal** but **self-contained** so they can be run in isolation (e.g. a task list under `tasks:` or a full play with `hosts` and `tasks`).
- Use **consistent** section headers so a parser can find them:
  - `### Example: violation`
  - `### Example: pass`

## Example document

```markdown
---
rule_id: L029
validator: native
description: Prefer command over shell when no shell features are needed
---

## Command instead of shell (L029)

Prefer `ansible.builtin.command` over `ansible.builtin.shell` when the task does not require shell features (pipes, redirects, etc.).

### Example: violation

```yaml
- name: Cat /etc/foo.conf
  ansible.builtin.shell: cat /etc/foo.conf
```

### Example: pass

```yaml
- name: Cat /etc/foo.conf
  ansible.builtin.command: cat /etc/foo.conf
```
```

## Integration test usage

A test runner is provided in `tests/rule_doc_integration_test.py`. It uses `tests/rule_doc_parser.py` to discover and parse rule `.md` files.

The runner:

1. Discovers all rule `.md` files (per validator) via `discover_rule_docs(native_rules_dir, opa_bundle_dir)`.
2. Parses frontmatter to get `rule_id` and `validator`.
3. For each `### Example: violation` section: extract the next fenced code block, run the engine on it, and assert that the reported violations include this `rule_id`.
4. For each `### Example: pass` section: extract the next fenced code block, run the engine on it, and assert that no violation is reported for this `rule_id`.

Code blocks must be valid YAML (and valid Ansible structures) so the engine can load and evaluate them without error. If the scan fails (e.g. engine dependency or bug), the test is skipped so the suite still passes.
